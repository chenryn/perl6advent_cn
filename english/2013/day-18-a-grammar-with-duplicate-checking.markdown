## Day 18 – A Grammar with duplicate checking

by [dwarring][4]

Today’s example constructs a grammar for tracking playing cards in a single deal. We’ll say it’s poker with one or more players and that each player is being dealt a hand that contains exactly five cards.

There is, however, the need to detect duplicate cards. We’ll need some way of tracking cards both within each card-hand and between hands.

**A simple Card Game Grammar**

To start with, here’s the basic grammar (no duplicate checks yet):

    grammar CardGame {
    
        rule TOP { ^ <deal> $ }
    
        rule deal {
            <hand>+ % ';'
        }
    
        rule hand { [ <card> ]**5 }
        token card {<face><suit>}
    
        proto token suit {*}
        token suit:sym<♥>  {<sym>}
        token suit:sym<♦>  {<sym>}
        token suit:sym<♣>  {<sym>}
        token suit:sym<♠>  {<sym>}
    
        token face {:i <[2..9]> | 10 | j | q | k | a }
    }
    
    say CardGame.parse("2♥ 5♥ 7♦ 8♣ 9♠");
    say CardGame.parse("2♥ a♥ 7♦ 8♣ j♥");

The  top-level rule consists of a `deal`. The `deal` consists of one or more `hand`s separated by `';'`. Each `hand` consists of 5 playing `card`s.

Each card is represented by a `face`, one of: `a` (ace), `j` (jack), `q` (queen) or `k` (king), or `2` - `10`. This is followed by a suite: ♥ (hearts) ♦ (diamonds) ♣ (clubs) or ♠ (spades).

[We could have used the playing cards characters, newly introduced in Unicode 6.0, but these aren't widely supported yet].

As expected, the first cut of the grammar cheerily parses any hand:

    say CardGame.parse("a♥ a♥ 7♦ 8♣ j♥");
    # one hand, duplicate a♥
    say CardGame.parse("a♥ 7♥ 7♦ 8♣ j♥; 10♥ j♥ q♥ k♥ a♥");
    # two hands, duplicate j♥
    

**Detecting Duplicates**

We start by adding a Perl 6 variable declaration to the grammar. This will be used to track cards:

    rule deal {
        :my %*PLAYED = ();
        <hand>+ % ';'
    }

This declares `%*PLAYED` [[1]][5]. The `'%*'` twigil  indicates that it’s a hash `'%'` and that’s dynamically scoped `'*'`.

Dynamic scoping is not only for subroutine and method calls [[1]][6]. It also works seamlessly with grammar rules, tokens and actions.

Being dynamically scoped, `%*PLAYED` is available to callees of the `deal` rule; the `hand` token, and its callee, the `card` token.

It’s also available to any actions, that then get called. So we can track and report on duplicates by creating an action class with a method for the `card` token:

    class CardGame::Actions {
        method card($/) {
           my $card = $/.lc;
           say "Hey, there's an extra $card"
               if %*PLAYED{$card}++;
       }
    }
    
    my $a = CardGame::Actions.new;
    say CardGame.parse("a♥ a♥ 7♦ 8♣ j♥", :actions($a));
    # "Hey there's an extra a♥"
    say CardGame.parse("a♥ 7♥ 7♦ 8♣ j♥; 10♥ j♥ q♥ k♥ a♦",
                       :actions($a));
    # "Hey there's an extra j♥"

And that might be all that’s needed  for tracking and reporting on duplicates. There’s a pretty good separation between the declarative grammar and procedural actions, with just one dynamically scoped hash variable.

**Disallowing Duplicates**

But I had a situation where I wanted duplicate checking to be a parsing constraint. Parsing needed to fail when duplicates were encountered.

I achieved this by moving the duplicate check grammar side:

    token card {<face><suit>
        <?{
            # only allow each card to appear once
            my $card = $/.lc;
            say "Hey, there's an extra $card"
                if %*PLAYED{$card};
    
            ! %*PLAYED{$card}++;
         }>
    }

This has introduced a code assertion between the `<?{` and `}>`  [[2]][7]. The rule succeeds when the code evaluates to a True value. The `card` token thus fails when the same card is detected more than once in a single deal.

    say CardGame.parse("2♥ 7♥ 2♦ 3♣ 3♦");
    # legitimate, parses
    
    say CardGame.parse("a♥ a♥ 7♦ 8♣ j♥");
    # fails with message: Hey, there's an extra a♥
    
    say CardGame.parse("a♥ 7♥ 7♦ 8♣ j♥; 10♥ j♥ q♥ k♥ a♦");
    # fails with message: Hey, there's an extra j♥

[This last technique works fully on rakudo/parrot today and should be available on the jvm in the near future.]

**Discussion/Conclusion**

One thing to be careful of with this type of technique is back-tracking (trying of alternatives). If, for instance, the grammar was modified in such a way that the card token could be called more than once for single input card, then we might erroneously report a duplicate. It’s still possible to track, but becomes a bit more involved. The simplest answer is to keep the grammars as simple as possible and minimize back-tracking.

If in any doubt,  please consider using one or more of the Grammar::Debugger, Grammar::Tracer [[3]][8] or the debugger [[4]][9] modules [[5]][10] to track what’s going on. You can also insert debugging code into tokens or rules as closures: `{ say "here" }` [[6]][11].

That the exercise for today; a simple Perl 6 Grammar to parse playing-cards in a card-game, but with duplicate checks using either actions or code assertions.
