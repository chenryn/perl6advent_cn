## Day 02 – The humble type object

by [carl][4]

For some inscrutable reason, we have defined a `Dog` class in today’s post.

class Dog \{
    has $.name;
\}

Don’t ask me why — maybe we’re writing software for a kennel? Maybe we’re writing software _for_ dogs? “Teach your dog how to type!” Clever dogs can do up to 10 words a minute, with surprisingly few typos.

Anyway. Having a `Dog` class gives us the dubious pleasure of being able to create dogs out of thin air and passing them to functions. No surprise there.

sub check(Dog $d) \{
    say "Yup, that's a dog for sure.";
\}

my Dog $dog .= new(:name);
check($dog);     # Yup, that's a dog for sure.

But where there _might_ be some surprise — if you haven’t gotten used to the idea of Perl 6′s type objects yet — is that you can also do _this_:

check(Dog);      # Yup, that's a dog for sure.

What did we just do there?

We didn’t pass _a_ dog to the function, we passed `Dog` to the function. And the function accepts it and says it’s a dog, too. So, `Dog` is a dog. Huh.

What’s going on here is that in Perl 6 when we declare a class `Dog` like we just did, the word `Dog` ends up having two meanings:

* The class `Dog` that we declared.
* The **type object** `Dog`, kind of a patron saint for all `Dog` objects ever instantiated.

Cramming two concepts into one word like this seems like a recipe for failure. But it turns out it works _surprisingly_ well.

Before we look at the reasons for using type objects, let’s find out a bit more about what they are.

say Dog;          # (Dog)
say Dog.name;     # ERROR: Cannot look up attributes in a type object
say ?Dog;         # False
say defined Dog;  # False

So, in summary, the `Dog` type object identifies itself as `(Dog)`, it refuses to have its attribute inspected, it boolifies to `False`, and it’s not defined. Contrast this with an instance of `Dog`:

say $dog;         # Dog.new(name =&gt; "Fido")
say $dog.name;    # Fido
say ?$dog;        # True
say defined $dog; # True

An instance is everthing the type object isn’t: it knows how to output itself, it will happily tell you its name, and it’s both `True` and defined. Nice.

(Being undefined is only _almost_ a surefire way to identify the type object. Someone could have gone through the trouble of making their instance object undefined. As they say in the industry, you don’t _have_ to be a type object to be undefined… but it helps!)

And now, as promised, the Top Five Reasons Type Objects Work Surprisingly Well:

1. Classes actually make sense as objects in the program. There’s this idea that classes have to haughtily refuse to play among the rest of the values in a program, that they have to somehow be like gods looking down on the instances from a Parthenon of class-hood. Perl 5 kind of has it like that. But both Ruby and Python show that classes can behave as more or less normal objects. In Perl 6, `Dog` is also what you get if you do `$dog.WHAT`.
2. It fits quite well with the whole smartmatching thing. So what `$dog ~~ Dog` actually means is something like “hey, `Dog` type object, does this `$fido` look anything like you?”. The type object doesn’t just sit there, it does useful things like smartmatching.
3. Another thing: the whole reason that line, `my Dog $dog .= new(:name);`, works as it does is because we end up calling `.new` on the type object. So here’s what that line does in slow motion. It desugars to a declaration and an assignment. The declaration is `my Dog $dog;` and so, because the `$dog` variable needs to start out with _some_ undefined value, it starts out with `Dog`, the type object. The assignment then is simply `$dog.=new`, which is short for `$dog = $dog.new`. Conveniently, because the type object `Dog` is an object of the type `Dog`, it has a `.new` method (inherited from `Mu` in this case) that knows how to construct dogs.
4. A little detail from that last point, which actually turns out to be a rather big deal: Perl 6 doesn’t really have `undef` like Perl 5 does. It turned out that `undef` wasn’t a really good fit with a type system; `undef` gets in everywhere, and doesn’t really _have_ a type at all. (A bit like Java’s `null` which is known to have caused people no end of suffering.) So what Perl 6 has instead are these _typed undefined values_, namely — you guessed it — the type objects. If you declare a variable `my Int $i`, then `$i` will start out as undefined, that is, containing the type object `Int`.
5. Not only do you sometimes want to call `.new` on the type object, sometimes you have other methods which don’t require an instance. (These kinds of methods are sometimes known as static methods in some languages, and class methods in other languages. Some languages have both of these, and they’re different, just to be confusing.) Again, the type object comes to the rescue here, sort of acts like an instance so that you can call your method on it, and then once again fades into the background. For example, if the class `Dog` had a `method bark { say "woof" }` then the `Dog` type object would be able to bark just as well as actual dog instances. (But the type object still refuses to tell you its `.name`, or any of its attributes.)

So that’s type objects for you. They’re sitting in a convenient semantic spot halfway between the class and its instances, sometimes representing one end of the spectrum, sometimes the other.

One thing before we part ways today. It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes you _do_ want to be able to tell type objects and real instances apart, for example when accepting parameters in a function:

multi sniff(Dog:U $dog) \{
    say "a type object, of course"
\}
multi sniff(Dog:D $dog) \{
    say "definitely a real dog instance"
\}

sniff Dog;    # a type object, of course
sniff $dog;   # definitely a real dog instance

Here, `:U` stands for “undefined” and `:D` for “defined”. (And that, dear friends, is how we got a _smiley_ into the design of Perl 6. Program language designers, take heed.) As I mentioned parenthetically before, it’s actually possible to be an undefined object without being a type object. For these special occasions, we have `:T`, but this modifier isn’t implemented in Rakudo as of this writing. (Though moritz++ informs me that, in Rakudo, `:U` currently has the semantics that `:T` should have.)

Let’s just end this post with maybe the corniest one-liner ever to see the light of day in `#perl6`:

$ perl6 -e 'say (my @a = "Hip " x 2), @a.^name, "!"'
Hip Hip Array!
